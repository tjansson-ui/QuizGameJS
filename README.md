Quiz Challenge was generated as part of the UW coding bootcamp. 

Webpage displays a quiz upon clicking the start button and resets the page with the return button. 
There is future functionality built to allow for a leaderboard display. 

The aim was to satisfy the following acceptance criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

This is incomplete since a user can't submit initials yet.
